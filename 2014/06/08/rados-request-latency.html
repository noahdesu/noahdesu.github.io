  <article class="post-content">
    <p>How fast can RADOS process a request? The answer depends on a lot of factors
such as network and I/O performance, operation type, and all sorts of
flavors of contention (e.g. too few PGs). Today we&#39;ll focus on the latency
added due to request processing inside an OSD.</p>

<p>We are going to do our performance analysis by post-processing execution
traces collected using LTTng-UST. Check out <a href="/2014/06/01/tracing-ceph-with-lttng-ust.html">Tracing Ceph With LTTng</a> for more
information on instrumenting Ceph.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start by profiling the performance of the RADOS <code>create</code> operation.
First we need to create a workload generator. It couldn&#39;t be simpler: call
<code>ioctx.create</code> with a unique object name in a loop and record the latency of
each operation. Here is the kernel of the workload tool:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c--" data-lang="c++"><span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="c1">// log (start, duration)</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3>Client Observed Latency</h3>

<p>I ran this workload for five minutes against a single OSD using the in-memory
object store. The experiment collected approximately 250,000 operations. Here
is the distribution of latencies as observed by the client. With the exception
of some outliers, the expected latency is about 1.1 milliseconds. That&#39;s a
pretty long time, considering we are going over the loopback and never
touching an I/O device!</p>

<p>|(ms)      |Client |
|mean   |       1.145|
|std    |       0.102|
|min    |       0.597|
|25%    |       1.103|
|50%    |       1.144|
|75%    |       1.187|
|max    |      12.700|</p>

<p>These latencies reflect <em>everything</em>, such as client library overhead, the
network round-trip, and all request processing that occurs in the OSD. What
contributes to the high latency? Next we&#39;ll look at a subset of the processing
that occurs in the OSD.</p>

<h1>OSD Operation Handling</h1>

<p>The following graph shows the typical execution flow that an OSD follows
while processing a client request. Starting at the top left the <code>Messenger</code>
dispatches a message to the OSD which finishes by placing the request on the
<code>OpWQ</code> workqueue. One can think of the dispatch phase as being analogous to
the top half of an IRQ handler.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/osd_op_flow.png" alt="Image"></p>

<p>A queued operation is plucked off of <code>OpWQ</code> by a worker thread, and this is
where the actual work associated with an operation occurs. Continuing with our
IRQ analogy, this is like the bottom half handler. We further separate this
phase into the portion that executes the transaction associated with the
request. We&#39;ve instrumented the OSD and client using LTTng-UST, collected
traces, and broken down request processing latency by phases.</p>

<h3>Message Dispatch</h3>

<p>The message dispatch latency represents the amount of time taken by the OSD,
following message receipt, to perform any initial processing and place the
request on the workqueue.</p>

<p>|(ms)     |Client      |Dispatch|
|mean   |       1.145|0.094   |
|std    |       0.102|0.005   |
|min    |       0.597|0.053   |
|25%    |       1.103|0.093   |
|50%    |       1.144|0.093   |
|75%    |       1.187|0.094   |
|max    |      12.700|1.138   |</p>

<p>So this is pretty fast at around 9 microseconds. The max time taken was about
1.1 milliseconds, so that isn&#39;t what caused our huge 12 millisecond latency.</p>

<h3>Queue Latency</h3>

<p>Once a message has been placed on the workqueue it sits idle until a worker
thread gets off its ass and handles it.</p>

<p>|(ms)     |Client      |Dispatch|OpWQ|
|mean   |       1.145|0.094   |0.042|
|std    |       0.102|0.005   |0.011|
|min    |       0.597|0.053   |0.000|
|25%    |       1.103|0.093   |0.038|
|50%    |       1.144|0.093   |0.041|
|75%    |       1.187|0.094   |0.045|
|max    |      12.700|1.138   |0.668|</p>

<p>Alright, so we can add on about 4 more microseconds that the request is
sitting in the queue. Still, we don&#39;t know what caused the max client latency.</p>

<h3>Request Handling</h3>

<p>The request handling latency added to the table below shows the time
taken by a worker thread to handle a request. Check out the max: we&#39;ve
narrowed down where that big latency came from. It doesn&#39;t tell us exactly
what happened, but it does tell us interesting things like it probably
<em>wasn&#39;t</em> the network or queuing delay (we need more instrumentation points to
really get to the bottom of things).</p>

<p>|(ms)     |Client      |Dispatch|OpWQ|Req Handling|
|mean   |       1.145|0.094   |0.042| 0.225|
|std    |       0.102|0.005   |0.011| 0.078|
|min    |       0.597|0.053   |0.000| 0.122|
|25%    |       1.103|0.093   |0.038| 0.215|
|50%    |       1.144|0.093   |0.041| 0.221|
|75%    |       1.187|0.094   |0.045| 0.228|
|max    |      12.700|1.138   |0.668|11.637|</p>

<p>Now things are starting to add up. Note that in this phase we have a large
latency. It looks like that big client spike probably came from here (although
this isn&#39;t a definitive test).</p>

<h3>Transaction Handling</h3>

<p>Finally, we show latencies for the portion of request handling that
corresponds
to the actual operation specific transaction. Note that the latencies
described in the previous sections are non-overlapping phases in that
their latencies add together. However, transaction handling described here
is a subset of the request handling phase.</p>

<p>|(ms)     |Client      |Dispatch|OpWQ|Req Handling|Tx Handling|
|mean   |       1.145|0.094   |0.042| 0.225|0.021|
|std    |       0.102|0.005   |0.011| 0.078|0.002|
|min    |       0.597|0.053   |0.000| 0.122|0.011|
|25%    |       1.103|0.093   |0.038| 0.215|0.020|
|50%    |       1.144|0.093   |0.041| 0.221|0.020|
|75%    |       1.187|0.094   |0.045| 0.228|0.020|
|max    |      12.700|1.138   |0.668|11.637|0.161|</p>

<p>Check out the max row again. Since transaction handling is a subset
of the request handling phase we can completely rule out transaction handling
as the cause of the large latency. The large latency is happening some where
else in the request handling phase.</p>

<p>This is just touching the surface of latency analysis. Stay tuned for more!</p>
