  <article class="post-content">
    <p>A powerful feature of <a href="http://ceph.com/docs/master/rados/">RADOS</a> is its ability to atomically execute
multiple operations on a single object. For instance, object writes can be
combined with updates to a secondary index, and <a href="http://ceph.com/docs/master/rados/">RADOS</a> will guarantee
consistency by applying the updates in a transactional context. This
functionality is used extensively to construct domain-specific interfaces in
projects such as the <a href="http://ceph.com/docs/master/radosgw/">RADOS-Gateway</a> and <a href="http://ceph.com/docs/master/rbd/rbd/">RBD</a>.</p>

<p>This transactional capability can also make it easier to construct distributed
applications through the use of custom interfaces, a simple example being an
atomic compare-and-swap primitive. Another common building block in
distributed systems is the use of an epoch as a guard on operations, and as an
identifier of the current system state. A client whose epoch is found to be
too old will retry its operation once it has refreshed its view of the system.
A recent example of a system that uses this approach is the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/corfu/">CORFU
distributed, shared-log</a>, in which storage devices reject writes that
are tagged with an expired epoch.</p>

<p>The following pseudo-code illustrates an object class in <a href="http://ceph.com/docs/master/rados/">RADOS</a> that
implements a guarded append operation:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-lua" data-lang="lua"><span class="n">func</span> <span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">epoch</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">payload</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">epoch</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">cur_epoch</span><span class="p">)</span>
      <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">STALE_EPOCH</span>
    <span class="k">else</span>
      <span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">payload</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">OK</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3>Guarded-append Benchmark</h3>

<p>In order to test the performance of this interface we can simulate it by using
the ability of the <a href="https://github.com/ceph/ceph/blob/master/src/include/rados/librados.hpp">librados::ObjectOperation</a> to perform compound operations.
The code snippet below shows the essence of the benchmark we used to test the
performance of the guarded write interface shown above. The operation appends
a 4K buffer, and performs an equality test on an omap index value, both of
which are executed remotely on the OSD in a transactional context.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c--" data-lang="c++"><span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(;;)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">librados</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">ObjectWriteOperation</span> <span class="n">op</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">op</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bl</span><span class="p">);</span>                 <span class="c1">// 4K blob</span>
    <span class="n">op</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">omap_cmp</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">asserts</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">NULL</span><span class="p">);</span>    <span class="c1">// Simulate epoch guard</span>
    <span class="n">ioctx</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">operate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;obj&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">op</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The workload is repeated twice, once with and without the epoch guard, and for
a variable number of clients. Note that all clients are writing to the same
object. In practice writes will striped over a fixed set of objects, roughly
within a single epoch, so this workload represents a worse-case, but with a
large number of clients this shouldn&#39;t be an unreasonable approximation of the
workload.</p>

<p>The charts below shows the throughput and latency of the append-only, and the
guarded append workloads while we vary the number of client threads. The tests
were performed on a single OSD using an SSD as a journal, and an HDD for the
data drive. In the first set of charts parallel journaling was not enabled.
Notably, the throughput of the append-only workload scales up to
around 1600 ops/sec with 32 clients writing, while the performance of the
guarded append workload maxes out at less than 400 ops/sec, and with
significantly higher latencies. Why is the performance of the append with a
guard so terrible? This is most likely because each operation simultaneously
dirties an object and performs a read. Since reads are satisfied from the data
drive, this effectively serializes all the operations. So much for that SSD.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/guarded_append_no_parallel_journal.png" alt="Image"></p>

<p>In contrast, parallel journaling mode will send ops to both the journal and
data drives simultaneously. If everything succeeds on the data drive, it means
that reads can be satisifed sooner. Thing improve a bit, but they still level
off after about 8 clients.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/guarded_append_parallel_journal.png" alt="Image"></p>

<h3>Solutions</h3>

<p>While this post addresses a narrow use case, in general it would be useful to
be able to efficiently read from objects recently written without always
having to flush updates to the data drive, for instance being able to resolve
updates in memory to serve reads. Here are some solutions that address only
the issue of handling easily cached data elements.  Two potential solutions
come to mind, the first being rather general, while the second exploits the
fact that the epoch changes rarely, making it a prime candidate for aggressive
caching.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If the reason for the performance problem is that each epoch read requires
first flushing the journal, tracking object dirty state at a finer
granularity could avoid the flushing that results from the epoch read.
However, this may be a quite invasive change, and doesn&#39;t allow for further
optimizations such as caching the epoch value in memory.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow object classes to cache data. This is a very attractive solution
because it allows us to avoid doing any I/O. However, the current object
class interface won&#39;t allow this because the state of the encapsulating
transaction is unknown to the interface, making it difficult or impossible
to keep the cache consistent with the actual state on disk. By expanding
the object class interface to support a callback indicating the final state
of the current transaction, object classes would be able to perform their
own caching.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Solution 1 above is likely a quite complex engineering task, and while 2 is
helpful here, both techniques would be useful in general. In practice, the
solution to this entire problem is to use more objects :)</p>
