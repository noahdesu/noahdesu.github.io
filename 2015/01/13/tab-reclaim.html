  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I am going to attempt to publish a recurring post on this blog that I
construct when the number of tabs in the browsers on several devices become
overwhelming.  I&#39;ll post them here with a brain dump of what I was thinking.
This is the first such post.</p>

<h1>In-Memory Computing</h1>

<p>I&#39;m very excited about the potential of various types of in-memory computing.
Network performance continues to improve, and we are seeing some indication
with EC2 SR-IOV and Azure Infiniband support (Windows-only) that RDMA is going
to become available in the cloud. As locality continues to matter less, there
are some interesting things that we can consider.</p>

<p>The most recent concept I&#39;ve been pondering has been the use of <code>tmpfs</code> for
accelerating workloads. For instance, database storage is placed in <code>tmpfs</code> to
accelerate a set of queries such as analytics. This is viable for many users
even when considering the volatile nature of such storage. In fact, the
RocksDB wiki contains in-memory benchmarks and some indication that they have
been tuning the system for better in-memory performance.</p>

<p>One example of where this may work well is the use of RocksDB to accelerate
sorting of genomic data. A fork of SAMtools has been created which replaces
the custom external merge-sort algorithm in SAMtools with RocksDB which is
highly optimized for disk and SSD media.</p>

<p><a href="http://devblog.dnanexus.com/faster-bam-sorting-with-samtools-and-rocksdb/">http://devblog.dnanexus.com/faster-bam-sorting-with-samtools-and-rocksdb/</a></p>

<p>In this case using <code>tmpfs</code> will offer limited performance increases as the
dataset sizes are far greater than RAM capacity. However, we can consider the
constructing of network attached RAM disks.  A related project in which remote
RAM disks are mounted as a local file system is described here:</p>

<p><a href="http://hannes.muehleisen.org/DaMoN2013-remote-memory.pdf">http://hannes.muehleisen.org/DaMoN2013-remote-memory.pdf</a></p>

<p>I think that this particular approach is interesting, and using iSER combined
with RAID-0 may work very well. We can consider other approaches as well. The
GASNet system allows remote memory to be accessed as a global address space.
If we combine that (or maybe MPI) with sorting algorithms can we provide
extremely fast genomic data sorting?</p>

<p><a href="http://pcl.intel-research.net/publications/CloudRAMsort-2012.pdf">http://pcl.intel-research.net/publications/CloudRAMsort-2012.pdf</a></p>

<p>When a KVM virtual machine is created a user-space process provides some
memory for the guest to run within. What happens if that memory is actually
backed by low-latency RDMA accessible RAM?</p>

<p><a href="https://lse.epita.fr/lse-summer-week-2013/slides/lse-summer-week-2013-16-Gabriel%20Laskar-KVM%20Without%20QEMU.pdf">https://lse.epita.fr/lse-summer-week-2013/slides/lse-summer-week-2013-16-Gabriel%20Laskar-KVM%20Without%20QEMU.pdf</a></p>

<h1>LLVM</h1>

<p>I would like to do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Programmatically generate some LLVM IR that processes some memory</li>
<li>Create a read-only memory map of a file</li>
<li>Fork a worker to run the IR against the file</li>
<li>Return the results and free the LLVM IR</li>
</ol>

<p>It&#39;d be cool to do that in Go, but at this point Rust or C seems like a better
candidate. Although, using Go for coordination and some low-level C
helpers to do this might be the best solution:</p>

<p><a href="http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/trunk/bindings/go/">http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/trunk/bindings/go/</a></p>

<h1>Movies</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_babadook/news/1932405/best_movies_off_the_radar_2014/">http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the<em>babadook/news/1932405/best</em>movies<em>off</em>the<em>radar</em>2014/</a></p>

<h1>Databases</h1>

<p>Creating database systems is the cool thing to do right now. But there is a
huge design space when it comes to database systems. One of the most obvious
ones is how the hell do I even get a query into my system. Here is an SQL
template library for C++:</p>

<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8751396">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8751396</a></p>

<p>Well, I guess the DSL approach is different than actually producing a generic
AST for a query. Maybe this does that too. More broadly, here is a paper about
database architecture design trade-offs:</p>
