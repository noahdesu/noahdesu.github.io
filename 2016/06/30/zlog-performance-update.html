  <article class="post-content">
    <p>This post provides an update on the <a href="http://github.com/noahdesu/zlog">ZLog project</a>, including the latest
performance enhancements, and where we are heading next. If you aren&#39;t
familiar with ZLog it is a high-performance distributed shared-log. It is
unique in that it maintains serializability while providing high append
throughput, which makes it an ideal candidate in building things like
replicated state-machines, distributed block devices, and databases.</p>

<p>The design of ZLog is based on the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi12/technical-sessions/presentation/balakrishnan">CORFU protocol</a>, but adapted for a
software-defined storage environment. In our case this environment is the <a href="http://ceph.com">Ceph
distributed storage system</a>. For a lot more information about the motivation
behind ZLog and how it is mapped onto Ceph <a href="/2014/10/26/corfu-on-ceph.html">please check out this previous post
on the design of ZLog</a>.</p>

<h1>CROSS Funding</h1>

<p>Last year the ZLog project was selected for funding by the new <a href="http://cross.ucsc.edu">Center for
Research in Open Source Software (CROSS)</a>, an organization at the
<a href="http://ucsc.edu">University of California, Santa Cruz</a> that funds research projects with
potential for making open-source contributions. Since funding has started
we&#39;ve had numerous students contribute to ZLog, as well as providing funding
for myself to expand and further develop the project. <a href="http://github.com/noahdesu/zlog">The ZLog project is
development in the open on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h1>ZLog Version 2: Design and Performance</h1>

<p>Up until recently there has been a single implementation of ZLog (version 1),
and now we are excited to debut the second version of ZLog which provides a
significant performance boost over version 1. In the remainder of this post
I&#39;ll describe the two versions, and preview the upcoming version 3 which
offers further performance improvement.</p>

<h3>Performance Results</h3>

<p>The design of ZLog stripes a logical log across a set of Ceph object storage
devices avoiding coordination in the common fast path. We provide here the
result of performance benchmarks run on a single OSD. The ZLog implementation
is based on the Jewel release and we use the default configuration of Ceph
with the FileStore backend. The hardware is an HP Proliant system, with two
high-performance NVMe devices generously contributed by <a href="http://cross.ucsc.edu">CROSS</a>
founding member <a href="https://www.skhynix.com/">SK Hynix</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>2x 6-Core Xeon E5-2630</li>
<li>64 GB DDR3 RAM</li>
<li>2x 1TB SK Hynix M.2 NVMe (3D NAND)</li>
</ul>

<p>The following graph summarizes the performance results for a range of log
entry sizes. Small entries of 256 bytes see a speed-up of 1.36 using ZLog
version 2, and users writing 4K entries will see a speed-up of 2.45. The
performance difference between version 1 and version 2 becomes large with
increasing entry sizes where we observe a speed-up of 10.3 for 32KB entries.
This isn&#39;t surprising, given that version 1 stores log entries in LevelDB or
RocksDB which are not optimized for storing large values. However, version 2
introduced many implementation challenges that forced us to work with the less
performant version 1 until recently.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/zlog_iops_v1v2.png" alt="ZLog Append Throughput"></p>

<h3>Design Overview</h3>

<p>Version 1 of the ZLog stripes a log (an ordered set of blob entries) across a
fixed set of objects in Ceph. This set is referred to a stripe. Within an
object each entry (both the bytes associated with the entry, and metadata
maintained by ZLog) is stored in LevelDB or RocksDB (the <em>omap</em> interface in
RADOS). Since <em>omap</em> can grow without bound, there is little benefit to ever
changing the stripe (in practice it can be expanded or shrunk to handle
cluster hardware changes). The primary impact of this design on performance
can be observed by the graph above: large entry appends perform poorly due to
the limitations of the underlying key-value database.</p>

<p>Version 2 decouples metadata management from log entry management, keeping all
values in LevelDB or RocksDB small, and storing the variable sized log entries
in a bytestream interface (e.g. a POSIX file). This significantly increases
performance, especially for large log entries. However, this design also
introduces implementation challenges that extend into the client itself: when
objects grow too large a new stripe must be created. Coordinating this among
clients has been a challenge, but the current implementation is stable and
has been running now for some time.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p>The final version of ZLog that we will be investigating in the coming months
completely eliminates the use of LevelDB and RocksDB, using instead a very
compact in-memory index. Through a proof-of-concept implementation we have
seen nearly double the performance over version 2, but the implementation
requires modifications to Ceph itself and will take some time to implement.</p>
